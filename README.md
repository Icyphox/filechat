#filechat
Semester II Computer Science Project for CBSE Grade 12. (National Public School - HSR Layout, Bangalore - IND)

###Our Idea
We're doing a pretty simple chatting program (that even works through the interwebz if you have port-forwarding), using C++ (but mostly C stuff).
It logs to a binary file, so that takes care of the file handling that we're "supposed to implement".
We will also include chat history manipulation in order to also have "all forms of file handling".
Feel free to build and fork. 

OSS for the win!
