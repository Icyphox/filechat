#filechat
Semester II Computer Science Project for CBSE Grade 12. (LOL, sounds like something a school would say)

###Our Idea
We're doing the typical chat program using sockets, in C++, but with a twist. 
The chat will be logged to a text file, yeah, that's nothing great. But the real lol is, we're displaying the recieved message by retreiving it from the text file (yus, 'tis sad, I know). We have to do this, like it or not, 'cuz we **need** to have some sorta file handling shyt in it.
