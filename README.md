#filechat
Semester II Computer Science Project for CBSE Grade 12. (LOL, sounds like something a school would say)

###Our Idea
Well, we're using the ancient **Turbo C++**, so sockets is out of the question. Well, **@drakonizer** did some Googlings, and found
that we could just use file handling stuff (which we had to use anyway), and write to a shared folder, which will be accessible by 
the two peers chatting. 

#####TL;DR (It isnt that long, really)
The entire chat is done by reading and writing from and to a file.
